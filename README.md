# bookshop
## [tap to check demo](https://ashmankevich.github.io/bookshop/)

At the moment this is the MVP of my project which called 'bookshop', you can check my [issue](https://github.com/Ashmankevich/spa_bookshop/issues) to understand how I plan to develop this project further.

'bookshop' is a regular store where you can buy regular books. Nothing special, just books :)
